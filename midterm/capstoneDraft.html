<h1>Capstsone Draft</h1>
<h3>
    For my capstone project I am going to start making the portfolio that I am going to use to apply to the IMD
    program with. Since the application is due on April 1st, I want to start making my portfolio now.
    <br>
    <br>
    In this portfolio I am going to include a home page that will be very simple. I have found inspiration from other
    portfolios I have looked at, and I like the idea of having my home page just be a single photo that covers the whole
    page. On top of the picture I want to have my name or some text.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will also have a navbar in my portfolio that will link to different pages. For this navbar, I want
    to include buttons that change a different color when you hover over them. Right now I think I will make the buttons
    white when you are not hovering over it and light blue when you are hovering over it. Also, if you are on the home
    page for
    example, you will not be able to hover over the home button, it will just be a solid color (blue). All of the
    buttons will
    be on the right hand side, and on the left side will be my name or a logo that I make.
    I would also like to make the navbar semi-transparent but I have not figured out how to do this yet.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the buttons on the navbar I know that I want to have a page titled "About Me" that will have info about me. I
    also plan to include on this page links to my github account and LinkedIn account. I will also include a page titled
    "Projects". This page will have all of my projects that I will use to apply to the
    IMD major. I will have different types of projects, so far I know that I want to include programming projects, art,
    and photography. On my projects page there will be more links/buttons to get to each type of projects. For example,
    if you want to view my photography
    there will be a button/link to get to another page that is just for photography. I also have an idea to create a
    separate website for my photography so I can show off more of my web design skills. If I decide to do this then I
    might have a separate button on my navbar just for photography.
    <br>
    <br>
    I want the style of my portfolio to be very simple and minimalist so it does not look too busy. I plan to do this
    by only using a couple colors so the color pallet stays simple. Right now I am thinking of having one of the colors
    be light blue but that could change later. I also want my portfolio to look very clean. I am going to do this by
    making mh navbar very simple, and making my pages simple.
