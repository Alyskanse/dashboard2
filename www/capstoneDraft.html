    <h1>Capstone Project Summary</h1>
    <h3>
        For my capstone project I made a simpler version of the portfolio that I am going to use to apply to the IMD
        program.
        Originally I was going to code the actual portfolio that I was going to use to apply to IMD with, but then I
        decided to make that portfolio using wix because it would be easier and I could design it faster that way.
        The inspiration for my capstone project comes from the portfolio that I created with wix.
        <br>
        In this portfolio I have a home page, some projects pages, and an about me page. For my home page I wanted to
        keep
        it simple so I made the background a picture that I took in Hawaii of a sunset from inside a car. I thought that
        it was a good picture for a home page because it is interesting and it tells you something about me because
        I love being in tropical places and wish that it was sunny in Seattle all of the time.
        <br>
        For my projects page I included them in a drop down button on my navbar. Each projects page is very similar, and
        they use the same grid system so the format stays consistent throughout my portfolio. Originally I made the
        grids by using css but then I use javascript instead to dynamically make the grid system.
        <br>
        For my About Me page I made it by using two columns, one column is a picture of me that best represents who I
        am,
        and the second column is an explanation of the content on my portfolio and some facts about me. Since the
        picture
        of me has lots of blue in it, I made the background color for my second column blue so that they would match.
        <br>
        In general I wanted to make my portfolio very clean and simplistic, so I did not include any background colors
        on any pages besides my about me page. I thought that including background colors would make it look too busy,
        especially on my project pages because I want the focus to be on the pictures of my work and not the
        background color.
